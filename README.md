## Hi there üëã, I'm Dong
üå± Aspiring Junior Software Engineer

A quick and hands-on learner

I graduated from Telerik Academy's Alpha JavaScript track, where I spent 6 months learning JavaScript and web development.
My final project was a first place winner https://github.com/A64-React-Team-3/Final-Project-Messenger.
Recognized for my dedication, discipline, and helpfulness to colleagues, I was offered a mentor role in the academy.


üöÄ What I'm Working On
- Fullstack project D-books https://github.com/geass0621/D-Books
- JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Express.Js: Actively practicing React, JavaScript, Express.js and TypeScript, continuously learning best practices, good coding habits, and writing clean code.
